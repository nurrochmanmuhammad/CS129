    "In this exercise, you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits. Before starting the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.\n",

    "The functions you will complete are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- lrCostFunction.m - Logistic regression cost function\n",
    "- oneVsAll.m - Train a one-vs-all multi-class classifier\n",
    "- predictOneVsAll.m - Predict using a one-vs-all multi-class classifier\n",
    "- predict.m - Neural network prediction function\n",

    "**Instructions**:\n",

    "For each function, we have provided starter code for you. You will find a description of the problems followed by a cell which contains some code. You will have to write your own code in these cells to complete the four functions mentioned above. Once you run the cells, your output would be displayed. If it matches the expected output, then you should continue with the next part of the exercise, else, you would have to try again. \n",
